# csgo_latency
This repository provides all the needed code to generate a data set out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive POV demo files. 
The generated data of my process is stored in the following repositories:

- The data set can be found in the following repository: [csgo_dataset](https://github.com/julian1198/csgo_dataset)
- The used demo files are uploaded here: [csgo_demofiles](https://github.com/julian1198/csgo_demofiles)
- The parsed data is collected in this repository: [csgo_parsed_data](https://github.com/julian1198/csgo_parsed_data)
- The trained neural networks are saved in this repository: [csgo_models](https://github.com/julian1198/csgo_models)

For the generation of the pictures I used [HLAE](https://www.advancedfx.org/download/).
